* Tasks

** TODO Fix/explain issues regarding byte-compilation order

Because the order in which files are byte-compiled is not guaranteed, and because the =lint-compile= rule compiles all files in a single Emacs session, it can obscure compilation errors which would occur if each file were compiled in a separate session.  It seems that =package.el= can behave similarly, because it may compile a package's files without errors even though errors could occur if each file in the package were compiled in a separate session.

*** TODO Add option to byte-compile files individually

*** TODO Document this issue

** MAYBE Use =package-install-file= to install dependencies in sandbox
:LOGBOOK:
-  State "MAYBE"      from              [2020-11-13 Fri 20:47]
:END:

Rather than parsing them manually.  Might solve problems (like needing a newer version of =map= than is built-in) and allow some code to be deleted.

* Ideas

** TODO Set Emacs frame title in interactive sandbox
