=makem.sh= is a script to help build and test Emacs Lisp packages (not Emacs itself).  It aims to make linting and testing as simple as possible.  Source files and test files are discovered automatically from the project's Git repo.  Output is simple: by default, there is no output unless errors occur.  With increasing verbosity levels (with =-v= or =-vv= options), more detail gives positive feedback.  Output is colored by default to make reading easy.

Testing can also be done with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-sandbox.sh][emacs-sandbox.sh]], which allows package dependencies to be installed into the sandbox automatically, without affecting the developer's personal Emacs configuration.  This is especially helpful when upstream dependencies may have released new versions that differ from the developer's personal configuration.

* Screenshots

Some example output.  The first shows running the =test= rule with verbosity level 1, which shows which tests are run but omits each test's output unless it fails:

[[images/make-test-v.png]]

Increasing the verbosity shows green output for passing tests:

[[images/make-test-vv.png]]

The =lint-compile= rule treats byte-compiler warnings as errors:

[[images/make-lint-compile.png]]

The =all= rule runs all rules and treats warnings as errors:

[[images/make-all.png]]

Of course, with increased verbosity, it also shows which rules did not signal errors:

[[images/make-all-v.png]]

Copy =makem.sh= into your package's root directory.  Optionally, also copy =Makefile=, to make calling the script easier.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

The =makem.sh= script can be called directly or through a =Makefile=.  Use =makem.sh --help= to list available rules.

** Makefile

A default =Makefile= is provided which calls the =makem.sh= script.  Call it with the name of a rule and an optional verbosity level, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Run all rules.
  $ make

  # Run all lints.
  $ make lint

  # Run all tests.
  $ make test

  # Run ERT tests with verbosity level 1.
  $ make v=v test-ert

  # Run Buttercup tests with verbosity level 2.
  $ make v=vv test-buttercup

  # Run tests with emacs-sandbox.sh and automatically install dependencies.
  $ make sandbox=t autoinstall=t test
#+END_SRC

** Script

The script may be called directly to specify additional options.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  makem.sh [OPTIONS] RULES...

  Rules:
    all      Run all lints and tests.
    compile  Byte-compile source files.

    lint           Run all lints.
    lint-checkdoc  Run checkdoc.
    lint-compile   Byte-compile source files with warnings as errors.
    lint-package   Run package-lint.

    test, tests     Run all tests.
    test-buttercup  Run Buttercup tests.
    test-ert        Run ERT tests.

  Options:

    -h, --help     I need somebody!
    -v, --verbose  Increase verbosity, up to -vv.
    --debug-load-path  Print load-path.

    -f FILE, --file FILE  Check FILE in addition to discovered files.

    --no-color        Disable color output.
    -C, --no-compile  Don't compile files automatically.

  Sandbox options:
    These require emacs-sandbox.sh to be on your PATH.  Find it at
    <https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-sandbox.sh>.

    --sandbox              Run Emacs with emacs-sandbox.sh.
    --auto-install         Automatically install package dependencies.
